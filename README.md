The code should be executable in python. It should be straightforward to run as all the parameters are defined. 

This code is an alteration of the code from Prindle et al's "Ion channels enable electrical communication in bacterial communities" (2015).

This data is a simulation that generates datasets depending on the constants and initial conditions stated.

This program was run in Windows 64bit Windows 11 with Spyder version 5. It should run on Linux and MAC and earlier versions of Windows as long as python libraries are installed but this has not been tested.

To edit this, Jupyter or Spyder are recommended. 

To install simply download the file and load the file on the python interface of your choice.
The install time should take less than a minute on a normal desktop computer.

To run the data, simply execute the run command on Python.
The expected output is a blue curve depicting the curves of the wildtype in blue and the mutant in black. The run time should take a few seconds.

The data can be then written into a CSV file by uncommenting the last lines and the directory specified.
